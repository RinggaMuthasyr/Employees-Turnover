# Employees-Turnover

The HR department of a company in India is overwhelmed with the number of employees leaving the company.

The possibilities that occur when employees resign in large numbers include disrupting the company's operations, difficult to achieve company targets, it takes time and money to find replacements for employees who resign, creating a bad impression for the company, etc.

After getting enough insight about the previous EDA project (link: https://lnkd.in/gkbG67PD), I decided to create this project to build a machine learning algorithm that can predict employee Turnover of the company.

The initial test uses unbalanced original data, then the SMOTE oversampling technique is used to see if there is an increase in performance from machine learning.

Data balanced by oversampling technique is proven to improve machine learning algorithm performance (though the increase is not so significant).
